        "model": "The OpenAI API is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. Read more at https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview",
        "temperature": "In short, the lower the temperature, the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness, which encourages more diverse or creative outputs. Read more at https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/how-should-i-set-the-temperature-parameter.",
        "top_p": "If you use Top P it means that only the tokens comprising the top_p probability mass are considered for responses, so a low top_p value selects the most confident responses. This means that a high top_p value will enable the model to look at more possible words, including less likely ones, leading to more diverse outputs.

        "saving_responses": "Whether to save responses in the directory, where you run the app. The responses will be saved under '<YT-channel-name>/<video-title>.md'.",
        "chunk_size": "A larger chunk size increases the amount of context provided to the model to answer your question. However, it may be less relevant than with a small chunk size, as smaller chunks can encapsulate more semantic meaning. I would reccommend to use a smaller chunk size for shorter and a larger one for longer videos (> 1h).",
        "preprocess_checkbox": "By enabling this, the original transcript gets preprocessed. This can greatly improve the results, especially for videos with automatically generated transcripts. However, it results in higher costs, as the whole transcript get's processed by gpt3.5-turbo. Also, the preprocessing will take a substantial amount of time.",
        "selected_video": "Once you process a video, it gets saved in a database. You can chat with it at any time, without processing it again! Tip: you may also search for videos by typing (parts of) its title."
