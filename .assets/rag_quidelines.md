# Guidelines

You can either provide a question or just a topic from the video. If you ask a question, try to be as specific as possible. Your question should adress a specific topic or a passage from the video.

**Don't ask for a summary! This part of the application is not designed for that! Use the `Summary` part instead!**

## General tips

- be concise and specific
- don't combine questions unless they are closely related!
- don't include instructions, like 'explain in detail' or 'answer from a perspective of X' etc.

## Important notice ‚ùó

While this part of the application is designed to assist with your questions using advanced technology, it relies on a large language model (LLM) and therefore may produce inaccurate responses. LLMs may reflect biases present in its training data, leading to potentially inappropriate or unfair answers. The model might hallucinate, misinterpret questions, provide vague responses and does not possess true understanding. Responses might inadvertently include sensitive or inappropriate content. Please acknowledge these limitations and use the provided information with caution and critical judgment.
