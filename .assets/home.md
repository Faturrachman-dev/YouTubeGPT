# YTAI - Your personal YouTube AI

Get insights from YouTube videos with YTAI, an LLM-based app that allows you to summarize or even ask questions and receive answers about them! tailors YouTube video summaries to your needs, offering a custom prompt feature for summaries exactly how you want them.

Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/sudoleg/ytai) for more information! Also, if you like the app, I would be very happy about a star :star:

## Summary

If you have a relatively short video (<30 minutes), you can use the `Summary` part of the application. It allows you to provide **a custom prompt** to tailor the summary to your needs. As the video is short anyways, you could, for example, provide your questions here. Moreover, you can save your responses (if you are running the app locally).

Or you could ask to list all the topics in the video and then ask specific questions about them using the other part of the application (see below) ðŸ˜‰

## Q&A - Chat

The `Chat` part of the application is best suited when you have a longer video you have specific questions about. It is more efficient and less cost consuming, as only the relevant parts of the video are provided to the language model. Moreover, once you process a video, you can Q&A it whenever you want (as long as you don't remove the volume accidentally ðŸ˜…).

I've found that the chat function works especially well for videos with manual transcripts but it's also really good for videos with autogernerated transcripts. Personally, I use the chat feature for lengthy podcasts with timestamps, like podcasts from [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab), [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman) or [Chris Williamson](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisWillx). You can just copy the title of the section/timestamp and get a good overview of the topics discussed.
